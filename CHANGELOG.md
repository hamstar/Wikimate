## Changelog

Since v0.10.0 this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) and [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).

### Current development

#### Added

* New class WikiFile to retrieve properties of a file, and download and upload its contents.  All properties pertain to the current revision of the file, or a specific older revision. ([#69], [#71], [#78], [#80])
* WikiFile also provides the file history and the ability to delete a file or an older revision of it. ([#76])

### Version 0.11.0

#### Added

* Support for a section name (in addition to an index) in `WikiPage::setText()` and `WikiPage::setSection()` ([#45])
* Support for optional domain at authentication ([#28])

#### Changed

* Updated `WikiPage::getSection()` to include subsections by default; disabling the new `$includeSubsections` option reverts to the old behavior of returning only the text until the first subsection ([#55])
* Improved section processing in `WikiPage::getText()` ([#33], [#37], [#50])
* Ensured that MediaWiki API error responses appear directly in `WikiPage::$error` rather than a nested 'error' array ([#63]) -- this may require changes in your application's error handling
* Restructured and improved documentation ([#32], [#34], [#47], [#49], [#61])

#### Fixed

* Ensured use of Wikimate user agent by Requests library ([#64])
* Corrected handling an invalid page title ([#57])
* Fixed returning an empty section without header in `WikiPage::getSection()` ([#52])
* Prevented PHP Notices in several methods ([#43], [#67])
* Corrected handling an unknown section parameter in `WikiPage::getSection()` ([#41])
* Fixed passing the return value in `WikiPage::setSection()` ([#30])
* Corrected call to `Wikimate::debugRequestsConfig()` ([#30])

### Version 0.10.0

#### Changed

* Switched to using the *Requests* library instead of Curl ([#25])

### Version 0.5

### Version 0.4

* Added `WikiPage::newSection()` and `WikiPage::setSection()` (shortcuts to `WikiPage::setText()`)
* Added the ability to get individual sections of the article with `WikiPage::getSection()`
* Added the ability to get all sections in an array with `WikiPage::getAllSections()`
* Added the ability to get array showing section offsets and lengths in the page wikicode with `WikiPage::getSectionOffsets()`
