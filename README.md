# What is this?
Wikimate is a wrapper for the MediaWiki API that aims to be very easy to use.  It consists of two classes currently:

* **Wikimate** - serves as a loader and manager for different wiki objects (e.g. pages)
* **WikiPage** - the only object made so far provides an interface to getting/editing pages

# How do I use it?

First of all make sure you download [Sean Hubers awesome curl wrapper](http://github.com/shuber/curl) and put `curl.php` in the directory with all these files.

## Configuration

Need to make sure you have some configuration constants before hand so edit the config.php

    define('WIKIMATE_DEBUG', false); // turn debug output on/off
    
No need to make any more constants

## Usage

Include the `globals.php` file and create a new Wikimate object.

	include 'globals.php';
	$wiki = new Wikimate($api_url,$username,$password);

On creating a new Wikimate object it will log into the wiki api - **if it fails to authenticate** your `$wiki` object will be null.  You should get a meaningful error message telling you why it didn't authenticate.

You can also enable/disable debugging with the `$wiki->debugMode($boolean)` method - currently only output from the logon process is printed for debugging.

### Getting a page object

Once logged in you can start playing around with pages.  If the title given to the WikiPage object is invalid, your `$page` object will be null.

	$page = $wiki->getPage('Sausages'); // create a new page object
	if ( $page->exists() ) die(); // check if the page exists or not
	echo $page->getTitle(); // get the title
	echo $page->getNumSections(); // get the number of sections on the page
	echo $page->getSectionOffsets(); // gives you an array of where each section starts and its length

### Reading...

You can get the text of the page by using the `getText()` method which returns the text that was obtained when the page object was created.  If you want fresh page text from the wiki then just put boolean `true` as the first argument.

	$wikiCode = $page->getText(); // get the text of the page
	$wikiCode = $page->getText(true); // get fresh page text from the api and rebuild sections

You can get sections from the page as well, via the section index, or the section heading name

    $wikiCode = $page->getSection(0); // get the part between the title and the first section
	$wikiCode = $page->getSection('intro'); // get the part between the title and the first section
	$wikiCode = $page->getSection(4); // get the 4th section on the page
	$wikiCode = $page->getSection('History'); // get the section called History
	$wikiCode = $page->getSection(4, true); // get the 4th section on the page including the heading

You can even get an array with all the sections in it by either index or name

	$sections = $page->getAllSections(); // get all the sections (by index number)
	$sections = $page->getAllSections(true); // get all the sections (by index number) with the section heading names
	$sections = $page->getAllSections(false, WikiPage:SECTIONLIST_BY_NAME); // get all the sections (by section name)
	$sections = $page->getAllSections(false, 2); // get all the sections (by section name)

The array looks like this:
    Array
    (
        [intro] => bit between title and first section
        [Summary] => The summary goes here
        [Context] => This is the context
        [Impact] => The impact is here
        [Media Articles] => Links go here
        [References] => <references/>
    )

### Writing...

You can modify the whole article using the `setText()` method:

	$page->setText("==Testing==\n\n This is a whole page"); // returns true if the edit worked
	$page->setText("==Changed==\n\n I just changed the whole page"); // the setText() method will overwrite the entire page!

You can modify only sections of the article by adding a second parameter to the `setText()` method.  Please note you can't use section names here **you must use section indexes**.

	$page->setText("==Section 4==\n\nThis will appear in section 4", 4 ); // provide a section number to overwrite only that section
	$page->setText("==New section==\n\nStuff", 'new' ) // ...or make a new section
	$page->setText("Sausages are cylindrical packages of meat.", 0 ) // ...zero is the very first section

Minor edit switch and summary description are in the third and fourth arguments

	$page->setText( $text, $section, true, "removing spam!");

Here's some easier functions for editing sections

	$page->setSection( $text, $section, $summary, $minor );
	$page->newSection( $sectionTitle, $text );


### Other stuff

Something go wrong?  Check the error array

	print_r( $this->getError() );

Wanna run your own queries?  You can use the edit and query commands in Wikimate:

	$data = array(
		'prop' => 'info|revisions',
		'intoken' = 'edit',
		'titles' => 'this|that|other'
	);
	
	// Send data as a query
	$array_result = $wiki->query( $data );
	
	$data = array(
		'title' => 'this',
		'token' => '+\', // this is urlencoded automatically
		'etc' => 'stuff'
	);
	
	// Send as an edit query with content-type of application/x-www-form-urlencoded
	$array_result = $wiki->edit( $data );

Both methods return an array of the MediaWiki API result.
