The Wikimate project strives for a transparent and welcoming maintenance process.
Below are some guidelines for current and prospective maintainers.
Anyone is welcome to propose changes to this document via issues or pull requests.

Regular contributors are to be given collaborator status
(which includes commit access, the ability to merge PRs, make releases, etc.).
Note that at the moment this can only be done by the repository owner, @hamstar.
Contributors are encouraged to ask for collaborator access once you have had a few accepted PRs, and would like to help maintaining the repository.

## Guidelines for commits and pull requests

1. **Every change** (except for very minor ones such as spelling fixes) **should be made via pull requests**,
   rather than as direct commits to the repository.
2. **Maintainers should not merge their own pull requests**.
   This allows every change to be validated by at least another maintainer
3. Pull requests should comprise a single feature or bugfix.
   **Unrelated changes should be sent as separate PRs.**
   The exception are minor code cleanup changes,
   which can be included (as a separate commit) in the PR that prompted them.
4. **Commits should be atomic** (as small as possible while still representing a self-consistent set of changes)
   and have descriptive commit messages.
5. **Every PR should include a CHANGELOG.md entry**.
   This makes it much easier to prepare releases,
   and allows the change author to properly summarize it.
